Read what is open and say what deserves attention.

## 1. Read the open set

`gh issue list --state open` with the fields a decision needs — number, title,
labels, age. Read the whole set rather than the first page: the issue that has
been open longest is exactly the one a page limit hides.

## 2. Say what stands out

Present it as one table, ordered so the top row is the one to act on. What earns
a place at the top:

- An issue carrying no priority — nobody has decided about it yet, which is a
  different state from having decided it can wait.
- A high-priority issue with no branch and no recent activity.
- An issue filed automatically that no person has read.
- A cluster of issues describing one underlying cause, which is one epic
  wearing several numbers.

## 3. Stop there

Triage decides nothing. Say what you would pick up first and why, then ask —
the answer is the person's, and an agent that starts work here has taken it.

## Reporting back

You are invoked either on demand — by a person who already knows what they want
— or as one step of a run. The two report back differently, so establish which
before doing anything.

Call `worklist_claim_item` with no arguments.

- `no_anchor` — you were invoked on demand. There is no unit to settle: do the
  work above, then report what you produced to the person who asked, naming it
  by issue number or path so they can open it.
- `claimed: true` — you are a step of a run. Do the work above against the
  claimed item's `title` and `attachments`, then settle with
  `worklist_set_item_status` and the item's `item_uuid`: `passed` when the step
  did what it says, `failed` with a `halt_reason` when it did not, and
  `skipped` when the question no longer exists. A step that decided its work
  fails says so with the reason, never with `passed`.
- `claimed: false` with `already_running` — another session has it. Stop.

A claimed step whose work stops for the person's decision — a proposal they
must approve, a choice only they can make — does not settle at the pause. Call
`worklist_set_item_status` with the `item_uuid`, `status: "waiting"` and a
`question`: one line saying what the person must decide. That settles nothing:
the step stays open and yours, and the run shows them the question. Once they
have answered, do what the answer asks, then settle — never `passed` at the
pause, which reads the step done before they have decided anything.

A `skipped` settle also says what became of this step's work, as an `outcome`
with that outcome's evidence. A skip naming none is refused, and so is one
whose outcome has nothing behind it: you are the only one who knows, and a bare
skip leaves every reader after you guessing which of the three it was.

- `already_delivered` — the work is already done, in this repository or
  another. Give `references`, one per place it landed: a commit as
  `owner/name@sha`, a pull request or issue as `owner/name#123`. Each must
  already be on its repository's development branch, or, in this run's own
  repository, on the run's integration branch when it has one: a commit
  reachable from it, a pull request merged into it, an issue closed by a change
  merged there. Work that sits on an unmerged branch is not delivered, and a
  reference to it is refused by name. It is the one outcome that says
  something shipped, and a run reads it to know this step delivered even
  though nothing landed on its own branch.
- `left_out` — the run decided not to do this work. Give `outcome_reason`, one
  line saying why.
- `not_needed` — the question turned out not to exist. Give `outcome_reason`,
  one line saying why.

A `halt_reason` is read by a person deciding what to do next, so write it as
the blocker in words they can act on, not as an error string. Never leave a
claimed unit `running`: a step that stops without settling is
indistinguishable from one still in flight.
